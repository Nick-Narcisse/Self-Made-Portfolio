			<h4>Here is a list of a couple of <span>courses</span> that I believe to be of importance as well as projects associated with them. To view the source code click <span>"Projects"</span> link at the top of the page</h4>
			<br><br>

			<p><b><span>Data Stuctures and Algorithms:</span></b> Creating and understanding various functions and algorithms while coding with java. One of our key projects was to create a <span>sorting algorithim</span> for a companies roster of employees.</p>

			<p><b><span>Network Technology:</span></b> We were introduced to the fundamentals of Networking and were given assignments that reinforce our understanding. One such assignment was a project that required us to <span>disect data packets during transfer using wireshark</span></p>

			<p><b><span>IT Database Management Systems:</span></b> A compact and cohesive course on what Databases are as well as how to construct and maintain them. Through the usage of <span> SQL </span> and <span>PHP</span>, projects requiring the <span>creation of dynamic tables and databases</span> are given to us</p>

			<p><b><span>Web-Client Programming:</span></b> Learning the appropriate languages of <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and <span>Javascript</span> to create <span>dynamic and creative websites</span>. One of our projects was actually the creation of this very portfolio </p>
